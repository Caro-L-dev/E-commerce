### How to update Node.js
Check the current version of Node with `node -v`.

If node was installed via downloading the **official package**, just download the latest version that fits your use case & run the installer.

Else, if Node was installed via **NVM (Node Version Manager)**, then you can install a new Node.js version using `nvm install <VERSION>` or just install the latest version with `nvm install node`.After installing the node version you want to use, you have to switch to it with `nvm use <VERSION>`, like `nvm use 10.16.3` or `nvm use --lts`.

Tips: Install the `vscode-styled-components` extension to have the css highlights in the block definition!
